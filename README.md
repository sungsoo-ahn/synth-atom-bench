# SynthBench3D

**Scaling laws for 3D generative models via synthetic benchmarks.** Compare GNN, Transformer, and Pairformer architectures on controlled geometric tasks to predict which will scale best for 3D structure foundation models.

## Why synthetic benchmarks?

Real molecular data is expensive and confounded — you can't isolate *why* one model beats another. SynthBench3D builds synthetic tasks with known ground truth where the only challenge is a single geometric constraint. By measuring how each architecture's performance improves with compute, we extract **scaling exponents** that predict which architectures will dominate at foundation-model scale — actionable information you can't get from standard benchmarks.

## Tasks

Each task isolates a specific capability that 3D generative models need. Together they form a diagnostic suite that decomposes what makes 3D structure prediction hard.

### Hard Sphere Packing

Sample non-overlapping sphere configurations in a cubic box. The only constraint is **steric exclusion**: no two atoms can overlap (|x_i - x_j| > 2r). This tests a model's ability to learn **pairwise distance constraints** — the most fundamental geometric challenge. Difficulty is controlled by packing fraction (density) and atom count.

**Metric**: clash rate (fraction of generated samples with any overlap).

### Self-Avoiding Chains

Sample self-avoiding polymer chains: atoms connected by fixed-length bonds that must not self-intersect. This adds **sequential bonded constraints** on top of clash avoidance — the model must learn valid chain topology where consecutive atoms maintain bond lengths while non-bonded atoms avoid overlap. This isolates the challenge of generating structures with **connectivity and long-range self-avoidance**. Difficulty scales with chain length N, since longer chains are exponentially harder to fold without self-intersection.

**Metrics**: clash rate + bond length violation.

## Key Result: Compute Scaling Laws

For each architecture, we sweep model size and training steps under a fixed compute budget (5 budgets from 10^15 to 3×10^17 FLOPs), then fit a power law: `metric(C) = a × C^(-α) + floor`. The scaling exponent **α** tells you how fast performance improves with compute — higher is better.

| | PaiNN | Transformer | Pairformer |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **α** (clash rate) | **1.21** | 0.39 | 0.51 |

PaiNN scales fastest on hard spheres, reaching 0% clash rate at just 2×10^16 FLOPs. Its equivariant message passing is the right inductive bias for learning pairwise distance constraints.

### Self-Avoiding Chains

  <img src="docs/assets/chain_scaling_gr_distance.png" width="65%" alt="Chain g(r) distance compute scaling curves">
</p>

| | PaiNN | Transformer | Pairformer |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **α** (g(r) distance) | 0.15 | 0.38 | **0.89** |
| **α** (clash rate) | 0.19 | 0.24 | **0.90** |

On chains, Pairformer dominates — its pair representation and triangular updates give it a 2-4x scaling advantage over the other architectures. At the highest budget, Pairformer achieves 0% clash rate and the lowest g(r) distance (0.025). Bond violation remains ~100% for all architectures, indicating that flow matching alone cannot learn discrete bond-length constraints.

### Takeaway

Architecture rankings flip between tasks. PaiNN's equivariance helps most on the pure distance-constraint problem (hard spheres), while Pairformer's richer pair representations dominate when structure has sequential topology (chains). This is exactly the kind of insight synthetic benchmarks are designed to reveal — **the "best" architecture depends on what geometric challenge dominates your problem.**

## Architectures

| Architecture | Type | Equivariant? | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PaiNN** | Equivariant GNN | Yes | [Schütt et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03150) |
| **Transformer** | Global attention | No (augmentation) | [SimpleFold (Apple, 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11533) |
| **Pairformer** | Pair + triangle updates | No (augmentation) | [Boltz (Wohlwend et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00778) |

All architectures share the same **conditional flow matching** framework — the only variable is the velocity network. Same training data, same ODE sampler, same evaluation.
